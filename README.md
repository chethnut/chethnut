Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From playing the violin since childhood to instrument repair and violin making, I've always been driven by creativity and craftsmanship. Transitioning to software development, I found a perfect blend of creative expression and logical problem-solving. I thrive on learning new technologies and approaches daily, while also enjoying indoor climbing, gaming, and woodworking.
